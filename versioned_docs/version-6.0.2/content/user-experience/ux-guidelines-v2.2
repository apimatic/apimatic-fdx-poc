## SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION


### DOCUMENT PURPOSE AND INTENDED AUDIENCE

This document provides the user experience (UX) guidelines and best practices for FDX implementers. The intended audience is
anyone responsible for the financial data sharing interface/experience of any FDX-participating software or service. This audience
includes, but is not limited to, user experience designers, product managers, and software development teams.

In particular, these UX guidelines aim to accelerate design decision-making during implementation of data sharing experiences, as
well as specify what information and control must be given to end users.

The principles and guidelines in this document were developed following multiple sessions of consumer research, in accordance
with principles and recommendations from FDX, its members, and several organizations such as the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau (CFPB), the Clearing House, and the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC). Existing data
sharing experiences that are currently in production were also reviewed and served as input in the research and evaluation process.

These recommendations represent FDX’s perspective on how to provide access and control for consumers and businesses. These
User Experience (UX) guidelines should be used in tandem with other FDX publications, such as the FDX API and Security guidelines.
See References below for a list of reference documents.

Please note that the term “Required” refers to likely future certification requirements and should be considered as best practices until
certification requirements are established.

### SCOPE

This document describes the concepts of financial data sharing, data flow, and data clusters, followed by specific user experience
guidelines for an end user grant consent journey for financial data sharing.

More guidelines will be presented in future published versions of this document. Please refer to Appendix A: Topics for Further
Review for a full list of topics being considered.


### TERMINOLOGY AND CONCEPTS

```
Please refer to the FDX Taxonomy of Permissioned Data Sharing document for a clear definition of recurring terms such as data
provider, data recipient, data services platform, end user delegate, and end user.
```
```
Section 3 of this document describes the user experience guidelines. Two concepts are applied during the presentation of the UX
guidelines. The top level of a user experience is presented as a Journey. Each journey contains a set of Processes.
```
1. **Journeys** – These capture the end-to-end view of a consent management operation, such as granting consent, refreshing
    consent, or modifying/revoking the consent.
2. **Process** – Each journey is broken up into a process that maps to a specific user goal, for example, disclosure, authentication,
    authorization, etc. Processes contain steps and options for the user to complete each goal.

```
For example, granting consent is a larger Journey that the end user embarks upon. The Journey contains a few Processes, for
example authorize, which is a multi-step process. During the authorize Process, an end user will complete steps to select accounts
to include in authorization. Thus, granting consent is the Journey and the act of authorizing is a Process within that Journey.
```

### REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND CONSIDERATIONS

The following regulatory considerations are key drivers of these guidelines and must be adhered to for any user experience. Relevant
items and their source are included in the table below for informational purposes only.

FDX is a standards body and adopts these guidelines for general use among industry stakeholders. Many of the terms, however, are
subject to additional guidance under prevailing laws, industry norms, and/or governmental regulations. While referencing certain
laws that may be applicable, stakeholders should seek legal advice of counsel relating to their particular practices and applicable
laws in the jurisdictions where they are deemed to do business. Each participant must determine which laws, rules and regulations
apply to each aspect of the experience. See FDX’s complete Legal Disclaimer located at [http://www.financialdataexchange.org](http://www.financialdataexchange.org) for
other applicable disclaimers.

**Table 1 Regulatory Requirements and Considerations (including but not limited to):**

```
Certain Regulations Items
```
```
UDAAP (Unfair Deceptive and Abusive
Practices)
```
```
Need to be clear with the messaging as to what is taking place when a user
provides consent so that expectations are set properly.
```
```
Need to ensure that a user’s requested action, such as revoking access, is honored
completely to avoid the perception of deceptive statements or unfair treatment of
the member by allowing data flow to continue. If there are circumstances where
data flow needs to continue (e.g. to manage fraud), that it is disclosed clearly to
the consumer the circumstances under which the action would not apply.
```
```
GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act)
```
```
Cannot share a user’s non-public personal Information without their consent
except for a set of limited exceptions.
```
```
Need to allow users to opt out of sharing of user’s non-public personal information
with non-affiliates, except for a set of limited exceptions. See Title V of Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA); implemented by Reg. P.
```
```
ADA (American Disabilities Act)
Need to make sure that the UX/UI are compliant with ADA, e.g. usage of screen
readers, etc.
```

```
COPPA (Child Online Privacy Protection
Act)
```
```
Cannot collect or share personal information of children under 13; should be
enforced at the time of consent.
```
```
Electronic Fund Transfers (Regulation E)
```
```
Regulation E protects consumers when they use electronic fund transfers (EFTs).
Institutions must disclose the consumer's liability for unauthorized EFTs, the types
of EFTs the consumer may make, and any limit on the frequency or dollar amount;
fees charged by the institution; and error-resolution procedures. Institutions must
also provide a summary of various consumer rights under the regulation.
```
```
CFPB Principles For Consumer-
Authorized Financial Data Sharing and
Aggregation*
```
```
These principles established a set of guidelines for permissioned data sharing
related to data access, data scope, data control, informed consent, data security,
transparency on data access rights, and accountability for access and use. It
essentially calls out rules for consent, revocation access, and transparency of data
access.
```
```
* CFPB principles are not regulations, but should be considered when shaping the user
experience

sharing and flow, the consent components involved, and the concept of consent by
business purpose.

### PRINCIPLES GUIDING DATA SHARING EXPERIENCES

The user experience guidelines described herein have been derived from a number of sources:

```
 FDX’s core principles: Control, Access, Transparency, Traceability and Security;
 FS-ISAC’s initial work on DDA user experiences; and
 research into permissions and consent performed by The Clearing House.
```

FDX’s core principles of data sharing are defined as follows:

**Control**

End users should be able to permission their financial data for services or applications.

**Access**

End users should have access to their data and the ability to determine which entities will have access to their data.

**Transparency**

End users using financial services should know how, when, and for what purpose their data is used and only data that is required to
provide such services should be shared with the organization providing the service.

**Traceability**

All data transfers should be traceable. End users should have a complete view of all entities that are involved in the data-sharing
flow.

**Security**

Entities need to ensure the safety and privacy of data during access and transport and when that data is at rest.

Based on these core principles, the user experience guidelines contribute to building trust in financial data sharing. Consistency of
experiences that results from adoption of these guidelines means that end users will not need to learn new models or interactions
each time they opt to share financial data. Further the guidelines are informed by user research, resulting in clear and efficient user
experiences that ensure security and privacy.


### DATA SHARING AND FLOW

Financial data sharing describes the process by which a consumer or business entity uses an application or service to access their
own financial data, which is available at one of their financial service providers. This flow of data enables people and businesses to
manage and interact with their financial data using their chosen applications, experiences and services.

#### Types of Financial Data

Financial data can generally be considered in three broad categories:

1. **Primary financial data** is data associated with actual financial accounts, including balances, holdings, and transactions
    directly reflecting monetary and financial actions. There are many types of primary financial data; the most commonly
    accessed include banking and investment account data, but may also include commerce data, tax data, employment data,
    credit score data, asset information, and business accounting data.
2. **Customer identity data** is information about the end user that can be used to uniquely identify such end user, such as name,
    address, or telephone number.
3. **Derived financial data** consists of observations, analysis, or models developed with primary data as an input, such as a cash
    flow analysis. Derived data may be the result of numerous financial and non-financial inputs.

For the purposes of this document and guidelines, we will focus on the first two categories - primary financial data and customer
identity data that is often included or part of primary financial data. They correspond to the majority of financial data access
business purposes. Derived or secondary financial data is often proprietary information that is retained at the data source.

In the recommendations below, we discuss **data types** and **data elements**. Data types are categories of data that are accessed or
shared, for example, account balances, transactions or account statements. Data elements are the specific data fields within each
data type, for example, transaction ID in a deposit account data type.

#### Parties Involved in Financial Data Sharing

Please refer to the FDX Taxonomy of Permissioned Data Sharing document for additional definitions.

**Consumers** : are end users acting in their personal capacity.


**End Users** : include consumers, individuals acting in a business capacity, and entities, such as a business or other legal entity, who
are giving permission to share their data.

**End User Delegates** : refers to delegated persons or entities, such as End Users’ CPAs, brokers, fiduciaries and other advisors, who
have been authorized by the End User to grant permission to share and receive the End Users’ Financial Account Information on the
End Users’ behalf.

**Data Providers** : the entities who hold End Users’ Financial Account Information, including, without limitation to banks, credit unions
and brokerages.

**Data Recipients** : service companies, applications (financial apps), financial institutions, products and services where End Users (on
their own or through their End User Delegates) manage or act on their finances, whether actively managing their finances (such as
moving money or applying for credit) or passively doing so (such as garnering recommendations or insights).

**Data Access Platforms** : intermediaries that facilitate financial data access, transit, storage and/or permissioning on behalf of Data
Recipients or End Users, also commonly referred to as “Data Aggregators”. In some cases, Data Access Platforms do not have a
direct relationship with the End User. The data may be passed through without modification or may be normalized in line with
permitted objectives (e.g., parsed for readability or used to confirm other data). Data Access Platforms should not be misidentified
with parties who do not obtain End Users’ consent but gather data, sometimes referred to as Data Brokers or Data Harvesters.


#### Flow of Financial Data

Financial data flows from a data provider (source) to the data recipient (requester). Data access platforms/End user delegates may
be involved in one or more aspects of facilitating this flow. The financial data flow process is as follows:

1. Data sharing is often initiated with a prompt by the data recipient to the end user, in order to access their accounts.
2. The end user identifies the data provider where their accounts are held.
3. The data provider inspects the request and allows the end user to grant consent for data sharing.

With this permission recorded, the data provider and data recipient exchange access details to enable the flow of financial data. In
some cases, a data access platform may facilitate the access between the data recipient and the data provider. In this instance, the
access details are exchanged between the data provider and the data recipient via the data access platform.

**Some examples of the flow of financial data between parties are as follows:**

```
 Financial Institution (data provider) → App (data recipient)
```
```
Account transaction data flows to a budgeting app where it is used to track spending by category
```
```
 Financial Institution (data provider) → Service Provider (data recipient)
```
```
Account balance data flows to a loan-provider to determine the end user’s borrowing power
```
```
 Financial Institution (data provider) → Aggregator (data access platform) → App (data recipient)
```
```
Investment holdings from across multiple brokerages flow through an aggregator, which normalizes the data, to an
app where it is used to give a 360° view of assets
```
```
 Employer (data provider) → App (data recipient)
```
```
Employment information such as payroll data and W-2s flowing to a payroll, tax or loan application
```
```
 App (data provider) → Financial Institution (data recipient)
```
```
Credit score information or personal/business financial information going to a financial institution to help deliver
tailored financial services to that consumer or business
```
```
 Service Provider (data provider) → Financial Institution (data recipient)
```

```
Product recommendations based on portfolio data from across multiple financial institutions flows to a bank which
can then offer financial products to their customer
```
### CONSENT COMPONENTS

An end user granting consent to a data provider to share data with a data recipient requires a clear understanding of what is being
shared and with whom, how it is being used and how long this agreement will last. This consent should allow the end user to do so
without sharing their credentials for the data provider. With the use of a token-based consent, in lieu of credentials, and controls
around what they authorize to share, the end user can better manage access to their data. These components of consent include
data clusters, duration and business purposes.

The **data recipient** should clearly describe the consent components to the end user. The data recipient may optionally use data
services provided by the data access platform to service the consent components and to manage the various parts of the consent
lifecycle. Refer to the FDX Taxonomy of Permissioned Data Sharing document for more information on token-based
consent/tokenized access.

#### Data Clusters

**What is a data cluster?**

A data cluster is a term used to group a functional collection of data elements. As a fundamental part of the scope of consent, it’s
used to communicate to the end user what data will be shared when consent is granted and to ensure that only that data is shared.
An example of a data cluster would be ACCOUNT_DETAILED, providing the data elements needed to obtain balances for an
account. Standardizing Data Clusters provides a consistent definition for all parties involved.

Data Clusters provide the mechanism for the Data Recipient to identify what kind of data it needs for the service(s) it provides.
Likewise, Data Clusters allow the Data Provider to not only convey what data will be shared but to control access to the data to
ensure that only authorized data is accessible.

Data Clusters can be combined as “building blocks” to identify the data being authorized. For example, a budgeting business
purpose may want to access both ACCOUNT_DETAILED and TRANSACTIONS, a data cluster which covers all historical and current
transactions for an account. Likewise, different business purposes may be supported using the same data clusters. For example,
budgeting or mortgage applications might both have a need to access the balances for the accounts that where authorized covered
by the Account Information Basic data cluster. Once the Account Information Basic data cluster is authorized, the Data Recipient


can use that same data to support both business purposes. A Data Recipient should request the set of all Data Clusters that will
access all of the data they need to provide all of the services they perform.

See Table 2 Data Cluster Terminology for the full list of data elements associated to each data cluster.

**Data Cluster Uses**

While data clusters are used to communicate what data is being shared, not all data elements covered by a data cluster are of
particular importance to an end user. For example, the ACCOUNT_DETAILED data cluster includes a field that indicates whether a
balance increase is a fixed, percentage or dollar value. This field may be important to the Data Recipient to provide the correct
experience but is not relevant to the end user. However, there are some key data elements in each data cluster that are sufficiently
important that they should be specifically exposed so that the end user understands what they are agreeing to share. These
guidelines intend to provide a common name for each data cluster plus the list of key elements that should be openly disclosed to
the end user, during the Grant Consent journey as well as, later, when managing that consent. The guidelines specifically do not
intend to specify the tone and specific language that each entity uses, intentionally leaving that up to the individual entities. However,
each entity must include the specific key elements in the description, tool tip or explanatory content provided for the data cluster.

**Data Cluster Terminology**

Data clusters should be represented in a consistent way for the End User, across all involved parties and throughout all flows, much
like an industry taxonomy. This provides the following benefits:

- Harmonizes representation of data to be shared across data recipients, data access platforms and data providers
- Increases end user confidence in sharing data when consents appear the same across parties
- Facilitates interoperability across parties to avoid one-off bilateral agreements
- Allows data recipients to capture data sharing scope programmatically
- Allows data providers to limit data access based on the authorized data categories

**Data Cluster Components**

The table below provides the list of approved Data Clusters supported by FDX.

- **Data Cluster** - the enum included in the consent scope, either directly or registered for a Data Recipient.
- **Required Label** - the short label for the associated Data Category. This name must be displayed to the end user in the Grant
    Consent journey. The Data Recipient and in the disclosure step and by the Data Provider in the consent step. Likewise, this


```
name should be presented to the end user during Consent Management to ensure that the end user is aware of what data
they have authorized.
```
- **Required Key Elements** - a list of key data elements which must be included, either directly or in a more detailed description,
    such as a tool tip. The entity may provide additional commentary, as needed, using any tone or style they choose, as long as
    these terms are included for consistency.

The following terms are prescribed for use in all End User-facing interactions, applications, and experiences.

**Note** : These Data Clusters are intended to be used as documented herein.

#### Duration of Consent

Within the FDX model, the duration of the consent provides the context defining when and how long the data recipient will have
access to the end user’s data and whether the end user must take action to revoke access, if needed. It can be described in one of
three ways: persistent, time-based, or one-time (single) use. A single consent must use only one of these durations.

**Persistent**

Persistent consent is granted for ongoing
data sharing. This allows the data recipient
to access end user’s data, within the
constraints of the permitted business
purpose, whenever it deems necessary to
execute the service it provides for the end
user. Access does not have to be tied to an
explicit end user action or application
event, such as a daily updates for the
purpose of budgeting. With persistent
consent, an application can regularly
investigate an end user’s financial standing
in order to form data models or recognize
behavior patterns to inform a
recommendation engine. Persistent
consent should remain active until the end
user specifically revokes that consent,
either through the data provider or the data
recipient. As in the other cases, the end
user should always be informed about the
duration of the consent they are providing.

```
Sample Persistent Consent language
```
```
[Data Recipient] will have access to your account data at [Data Provider] until you withdraw
your consent to share this account data. You may withdraw your consent at any time.
```

**Time-based**

Time-based consent is granted when the service provided by the data recipient has a discrete window need to complete a specific
task such as applying for a loan. The consent is granted for the specific window (e.g., 90 days) and should be automatically
revoked at the end of specified time period. Access after that time will require the end user to re-consent. The specified time should
be communicated to the end user to provide clear understanding of how long the access will be active and why.

```
Sample Time-based Consent Language
```
```
[Data Recipient] will have access to your account data at [Data Provider] for the next 12 months, expiring on [end
of consent period]. You may renew or withdraw your consent at any time before the consent expires.
```

**One-Time Use**

One-time consent is granted for a single, discrete, and short-lived interaction. One-time use consent is tied to an explicit end-user
action or application event that requires only one retrieval of the required data, such as identity or account verification. The
expectation is that once the data has been retrieved, the consent will be automatically revoked, preventing it from being used again
at a later time.

The end user’s data may only be
accessed in the context of this
interaction and, typically, the data will
not be stored beyond the time required
for this specific interaction to be
completed. There are exceptions
when, for legal or regulatory purposes
(for example transaction records or tax
returns), the data that was accessed
may be stored for a longer period of
time. In that case, it must be very
clearly disclosed to the end user that
the data recipient will keep the data, for
how long and why. Further, the stored
data must not be used for a purpose
outside the scope of the original
consent without a new consent from
the end user and additional data may
not be accessed to contextualize the
original data.

```
Sample One-time Consent Language
```
```
[Data Recipient] will have a one-time access to your account data at [Data Provider] not to
exceed 24 hours.
```

#### Consent by Business Purpose

Data recipients may provide a specific service that the end user may want to leverage. With FDX, this service, or business purpose,
will be defined as a specific set of data clusters which provide the necessary data elements for that service as well as the prescribed
duration for that consent. As specific business purposes are established, data recipients must define their consent based on these
business purposes. The data recipient must clearly describe the primary business purpose with the data clusters and duration
required.

In some cases, data recipients may want to provide services for more than one business purpose. In this case, the data recipient
should indicate which business purpose, or cases, are required, and which ones may be optional. The consent provided by the end
user will cover, at a minimum, access to the data clusters needed to provide the services for the required business purposes.

### LIFE CYCLE OF CONSENT

FDX requires that exchange or sharing of financial or other end user (customer) data must be authorized by the end user. Ultimately,
the end user has control over who is able to access that data. The end user whose data flows between data providers and data
recipients or data access platforms must give informed and unique consent for the stated business purpose.

Data sharing must be **explicitly** permissioned by the end user. Changes to what data is included in the consent require explicit re-
consent by the end user.

While the consent itself represents this permission for a period of time, the user experience of data sharing takes place in three
discrete phases:

```
 Grant Consent
 Manage Consent
 Revoke Consent
```
#### Grant Consent

Granting consent is the process of **establishing the terms of data access** between a data provider (e.g. financial institution) and a
data recipient (e.g. financial application). In some instances, a data access platform may be involved as a way for the data recipient
to more easily access a larger number of data providers. A given consent defines the access that an end user has authorized.


The process to grant consent is initiated from within the data recipient experience.

The data recipient is responsible for defining the types of data, or data clusters, needed to support the business purpose(s)
presented to the end user. If the end user wants to enlist these services, they must consent to the data required to do so. The data
recipient must clearly explain what types of data they need and why they need this data to best inform the end user during consent.
In addition, this consent always has a prerequisite period of time, or duration. During the consent process, the end user directs the
data provider to share none, one, some or all of their accounts with the data recipient.

During the consent process, the selection of which accounts to access data from should be performed at the data provider during
authorization. This avoids any account information having to be unnecessarily disclosed outside of the data provider. The end user
must **explicitly** authorize the use of their data. Authorization to share data requires that the end user be presented with the
parameters of use and have the option to decline. Data providers MUST display the data clusters as they were presented to the user
by the data recipient at the disclose stage. Data providers MUST NOT permit end users to configure data usage.

Consent for financial or other data access is granted by one end user, to data recipient(s), for a specific set of data clusters (defined
by the business purpose(s) for which the data is requested), for a specific list of accounts held by a data provider, and for a specified
period of time.

#### Manage Consent

**Managing consent** is the process of maintaining or **modifying the access** between the data provider and the data recipient, and when
applicable, through a data access platform.

Management is typically handled through the data provider where the consent was given, but, in some cases, may be initiated by the
data recipient or through a data access platform experience.

More information and a detailed journey for how to allow an end user to manage their consent will be provided in future versions of
the FDX User Experience Guidelines.

#### Revoke Consent

**Revoking consent** is the process of **removing the access** between a data provider and a data recipient.

Access can be revoked from within the data provider, data recipient, or data access platform experience when applicable. If revoked
by a data provider or recipient, the access will also be removed from the data access platform when applicable.


More information and a detailed journey for how to allow an end user to revoke their consent will be provided in future versions of the
FDX User Experience Guidelines.

## SECTION 3: USER EXPERIENCE GUIDELINES


```
The prescribed journey shown below reflects the recommended information and functionality provided by the data recipient and the
data provider. They are intended to show who is responsible for each but not necessarily indicative of the number of physical pages
required by either the data provider or the data recipient. Screen images are meant to serve as illustrative examples of
implementations.
```
```
Please note that within all journeys, the term “Required” refers to likely future certification requirements and should be considered as
best practices until certification requirements are established. This is intended to provide a base understanding of the user
experience and thus journeys will change and adapt based on business purpose.
```
```
Refer to Table 2 Data Cluster Terminology on page 18 for specific data cluster terms that should be displayed in End User
applications.
```
### JOURNEY CONSENT


**Customer Grant Consent Journey**

The Grant Consent Journey consists of seven process steps.


```
Purpose — Motivate the end user to provide access to their financial data
```
```
This step provides details about how the end user can share their data from a data provider to the recipient to provide the services
requested. It i s important that the end user is clear about the benefits of sharing their accounts and who is involved.
```
```
Required
```
```
 A clear explanation of the purpose/benefits for sharing accounts to the application or service
o Provide a path to view a description of what steps are involved on a secondary screen, such as “Learn More”
o Include a description of what happens to data if the consent grant process is terminated or incomplete. Conversely,
state that the end user’s data will only be shared upon completion of the entire process, after confirmation
 If an intermediary data access platform, or any entity with access or that processes the data for their own purposes, is
involved in setting up access to the data provider, make that apparent to the end user, for example, “Data access provided by”
or “Data access facilitated by” (The exact language is to be agreed upon by the parties involved and must specify the
existence of the data access platform.)
o Maintain this indicator on all subsequent screens for consent and data provider selection
```
```
Recommended
```
```
 Description of Steps
o Increase comprehension by using a numbered list format to describe a sequence
o Be concise and call attention to the important part of the customer benefit
 Provide a path (inline or in an optional screen) to view details about the data access platform
 Ensure that the end user understands how their data will be kept secure through this process
 Consider a prominent call to action or guide first-time users through an explanation of the steps to share their data

The Money Movement use case allows the Data Recipient to be able to access certain money movement capabilities provided by the
Data Provider. In this use case, the Data Recipient is providing a service that requires the ability to execute a payment or transfer of
funds such as payments to a Data Provider product (e.g., credit card or mortgage, etc.), adding payees, paying external bills, person-
to-person payments, or transferring funds between deposit accounts. Such capabilities may be considered potentially risky and, as
such, the end user must be made aware of what they are authorizing.
```
```
It's important to note that granting consent to use the Data Provider payments and transfers capabilities is not the same as
executing the actual transaction. The end user must first consent to allow the Data Recipient to access the payment and transfers
functionality and related data. At a later time the end user may decide to execute a payment or transfer via the Data Recipient.
```
```
Once the consent has been granted, the end user is able to schedule payments or transfers and view related payment activity at the
Data Recipient via FDX APIs. In some case, a Data Provider may require a step up authentication when scheduling a payment or
transfer from the Data Recipient. The data cluster granted during consent allows the Data Recipient to use the APIs but the execution
method is beyond the scope of this document.
```
```
This section solely describes the Disclose and Consent steps of a money movement journey as they differ slightly from the standard
grant consent journey above.
```
### JOURNEY MONEY MOVEMENT CONSENT


**Money Movement Consent Journey**

Similar to the Grant Consent Journey, the Money Movement Consent Journey consists of seven process steps.

A money movement consent may consist of the following entities and data flows:


#### Disclose Sample User Content^

```
Following the same guidelines as the standard data sharing
Consent Grant journey, the Data Recipient must explicitly
communicate in the Disclose step that, in addition to the other data,
they need to access the money movement capabilities , as shown
here.
```
```
An optional Disclose implementation example is shown below.

##### 4

A separate Disclose screen for money movement is an **optional** implementation, such that it appears before or after the data cluster
screen for data sharing. This ensures that the user will not miss the vital money movement disclosure and provides a clear
separation of concepts between data sharing and money movement. The decision to use one or two screens is at the discretion of
the implementor.


#### Consent^ Sample User Content^

```
Likewise, the Data Provider must also inform the end user that
this consent includes access to specific money movement
capabilities during the Consent step. A specific message must be
shown that clearly indicates they are enabling the transfer of
funds (or other payment capabilities) through the Data Recipient,
thus providing the transparency and control that the end user
deserves.

## SECTION 4: POST CONSENT

This section describes user notification and consent management requirements.


**Purpose – Enable End Users to have confirmation of authorizing data sharing with a Data Recipient and a consistent experience
across open banking applications**

Providing a durable notification back to the End User via a previously established out-of-band mechanism, such as email, provides
additional assurance to the End User of completion of the authorization for data sharing and gives an opportunity for End Users to
identify unauthorized or unintended access requests. The notification also delivers a consistent verification experience across the
industry and with other consumer services.

**Required**

```
 It is the responsibility of the Data Provider to send a notification to the End User via the communication channel selected by
the End User. The involved Data Access Platform or Data Recipient may also provide notification.
 If the Data Provider does not allow a choice of communication channel, or if a choice has not been selected by the End User,
the default is to send an email notification.
 The content of the notification to the End User must:
o Identify the name of the Data Recipient that has been authorized to access the data
o Provide the date when the End User provided consent to the Data Provider to authorize data access for the Data
Recipient. For security, the date should be included in the main body of the notification
o State that the end user’s login credentials will not be shared with the named Data Recipient
o State the duration of the data access that has been authorized based on the duration of consent that has been
specified (e.g. persistent, time-based, or one time)
o Provide information on where the End User can review their data access authorizations, for example, directions on
how to manage the consent, such as a consent dashboard.
 Data Recipients and Data Access Platforms should provide the following information in a Terms of Use/Data Sharing Policy
that is accessible to the End User
o An explanation of the data security practices implemented so that the End User is assured that their consent
information and other sensitive data collected is kept safe and protected from fraudulent access
o An explanation of data sharing and privacy so that the End User knows if the Data Recipient/Data Access Platform will
or may sell/share their data
 Notify the End User when they have successfully revoked Consent
```
### NOTIFICATION


**Recommended**

```
 Data Provider may allow an option for the End User to choose the notification delivery method including:
o Email
o Text message
o Push notification to their Data Provider application
 The content of the notification to the End User:
o May choose to indicate that changing their password will not revoke access
o Does not need to include details of the lists of accounts selected or the data clusters being shared.
```

```
o
```
Notification (^) Sample User Content
**_Notification_**
Provide a notification to the End User via email, text, or push
notification that states the End User has authorized data sharing.
Identify the name of the Data Recipient that has been
authorized to access the data
Provide the date when the End User provided consent to the
Data Provider to authorize data access for the Data
Recipient. For security, the date should be included in the
main body of the email.
State that their online banking login credentials will not be
captured or stored by the named Data Recipient
State the duration of the data access that has been
authorized based on the duration of consent that has been
specified (e.g. persistent, time-based, or one time)
Provide directions on where the End User can review their
data access authorizations, for example, directions to find
the dashboard within their online banking service (for
security reasons do not include a hotlink to the dashboard).

**Purpose – Once consent has been granted to share data from a Data Provider to a Data Recipient, the End User should have the
ability to manage that consent.**

#### Overview

Data Providers and Data Recipients must provide a software interface for End Users to view, edit, and revoke Consent.

```
Note : Data Access Platforms acting as a Data Recipient are included in this requirement. Data Access Platforms not acting
as a Data Recipient may provide similar capabilities as they see fit. Any Data Access Platform that provides an interface
should use the Data Recipient examples as a guide.
```
This interface is referred to herein as a Consent Dashboard. This section describes the requirements that should be met for the
Consent Dashboard of each entity.

A vital component to user experience is the ability to manage consent via a consent dashboard. The required functionality that must
be provided to users is described herein. Also of vital importance to implementers is to ensure that all parties are notified of **any
change** to a consent via the FDX Consent API.

**Entity Notification**

Independent of end user notification, parties must notify each other of certain events. Regardless of where the Consent modification
originates, the entity capturing the Consent change request should implement a mechanism to notify all other parties of the change.
It is also desirable that the entity verify that all notified entities have acknowledged the notification. The notified parties should act
upon the notification and take any necessary actions to ensure that the end-user receives a consistent user experience, and that
there is transparency and traceability of any change actions.

**Consent Editing Journey**

Any changes to a consent should result in the end user reviewing the scope changes, authorizing all involved accounts, and
confirming the changes.

### CONSENT MANAGEMENT AND DASHBOARDS


If changes originate from a Data Recipient, the end user may need to repeat steps of the original Consent Journey, for example if a
new Data Provider must be selected. Ensure that the end user is redirected to the appropriate place in the consent journey after
making a change to a Consent.

**Note:** All parties must be notified of any changes to consent via the Consent API.


#### Data Provider

View Consent from a Data Provider

**View Consent**

End Users should be able to view the following from a Data Provider Consent Dashboard:

- The entities with which the data is being shared.
    o It should be indicated if one or more Data Access Platforms have access to the End User’s data, along with the names
       of any Data Access Platforms involved in the Consent. Provide access to additional information about the Data
       Access Platform and its role, including links if possible.
- The duration of Consent specifying the exact date that the Consent will expire, along with the date that the current Consent
    was granted. If the Consent was renewed, then the date of renewal should be displayed as the date the Consent was granted.
- The accounts authorized under the Consent.
- The data items (clusters) that are being shared for the accounts authorized under the Consent. These should be specified in
    language that is clear to the End User and a lay person, such as “transactions” or “statements”.
- The Consent Dashboard should be accessible at all times.
- Prior Consents or a link to prior Consents that have expired or have been revoked within a timeframe consistent with the Data
    Provider data usage policy should be displayed, along with the date of expiration/revocation.


Consent Dashboard – Data Provider (^) Sample User Content

Edit from a Data Provider

The following functionality should be provided to end users for editing the scope of a consent. Users will have to complete certain
steps in the Consent Journey after making changes in order to fulfill the scope change. Within a Data Provider flow, the Consent
Dashboard should be considered an editable version of a Consent screen.

All edits to a Consent require a final **acknowledgement** from the end user. The end user should be clearly notified of the changes
being made to the Consent with an option to **approve** or **cancel**. The Consent API should be used to notify all involved parties of any
changes to a Consent, whether user-initiated or system-initiated.

**End User Initiated Changes**

**_Increases of Scope_**

- Add an account
- Extend/renew the consent
- Change a time scope/duration-based consent to a persistent consent (if applicable)
- Enhance the look back period (e.g. 3 months to 1 year)

**_Decreases of Scope_**

- Remove an account (sole owner)
- Remove an account (joint owner)
- Provide standing instructions on addition or removal of an account, for example an automatically add new accounts check
    box on an account selection screen
- Reduce the time scope/duration of consent, for example from Persistent to time-based
- Reduce the look back period, for example from 1 year to 3 months


**System Initiated Changes**

**_Increases of Scope_**

- An authorized user opens a new account
- A new account type is available
- The Financial Institution changes name (via new branding, merger, or acquisition)
- The End User undergoes a legal name change

**_Decreases of Scope_**

    has access to the account. This could occur in a a joint, authorized or delegated end user situation.
- The account is closed by the financial institution
- An end user closes the account
- The authorized user (delegate) has a change in permissions on an existing account, for example if the delegated user no
    longer has an explicit permission to the account but still has read/view access to transactions
- A reduction of API capabilities that affect the consent (example - statements no longer provided)

### APPENDIX A: TOPICS FOR FURTHER REVIEW

The following topics have been identified as needing additional discussion. They will be addressed in later versions of this document
after they have been vetted.

This list is not exhaustive. Additional items may be added as they are identified. The order of when they will be addressed is to be
determined by the FDX User Experience Working Group. Please contact the UX Working Group if there are topics not listed here that
should be addressed.

```
 Additional clarifications on the Consent flow

 Guidelines for end users to change/manage consent from the consent dashboards
 Data Clusters
o Defining more data clusters
o What granularity is needed in presenting data clusters to end users?
o Special considerations for sensitive data, such as PII, DOB, SSN, etc.
o Mapping data clusters to business purposes
o Should specific content/phrases be prescribed for consistency?
o How to handle changes to data clusters? When does a new element require re-consent?
o Association of data clusters to APIs
 Duration of consent (all) - how to properly ensure communication to the end user by both the data provider and the data
recipient
 Handoff/Redirecting – Discuss requiring indications to users when they are being redirected to Data Provider and back to
Recipient.
