## INTRODUCTION

The Financial Data Exchange, LLC (FDX) is a technical standards body composed of financial
institutions, financial technology companies, data access platforms (data aggregators),
consumer groups and industry trade associations participating in the user-permissioned
financial data ecosystem. Entities in this ecosystem occupy roles as user-permissioned data
providers, data access platforms and data recipients as directed by the consumer or business.
Some of these entities can occupy multiple roles at the same time. FDX seeks the development
and promotion of a common, interoperable, and royalty-free standard – the FDX API - to
facilitate the secure exchange of financial information and accelerate innovation while giving
consumers and businesses greater control of their data and better awareness of how it is being
used.

In an effort to align industry stakeholders and help regulators and policymakers better
understand and define the various roles and perspectives within the user-permissioned financial
data ecosystem, FDX proposes the following set of common terminology to be used as a
taxonomy. FDX is also providing a conceptual flow model to show how End Users interact with
different participants within the current ecosystem that is evolving from legacy to new
technology. This document also provides a cursory comparison of similar terminology in the
permissioned data sharing space among other parties such as the U.S. Department of Treasury,
U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and other key parties in the financial services
industry. Additional markets outside the U.S. were reviewed for informational purposes, for
example the “Consumer-Directed Finance” report of the Canadian Minister’s Advisory
Committee on Open Banking, Australian Consumer Data Standards and the European Banking
Authority (EBA).

FDX has adopted the taxonomy of terms set forth herein in all of its documents, artifacts and
specifications moving forward. FDX is a standards body and also adopts this taxonomy for
general use among its members, industry stakeholders, and others as normative. This implies
that improper use of a term constitutes a blocking event that requires correction. For example, a
Request for Comment (RFC) may be declined for improper use of a term. The same applies to
all other documents being published, such as marketing materials or sanctioned newsroom
articles. Many of the terms, however, are subject to additional interpretations under prevailing
laws, industry norms, and/or governmental regulations.

FDX welcomes comments and suggestions to its proposed taxonomy. Please send your
comments to info@FinancialDataExchange.Org. Additionally, FDX will update this Taxonomy of
Permissioned Data Sharing from time to time and change the version and date specified above
with each new revision.


### TAXONOMY OF PERMISSIONED DATA SHARING

```
Consumers : are end users acting in their personal capacity.
```
```
End Users : includes Consumers, individuals acting in a business capacity, and
entities, such as a business or other legal entity, who are giving permission to
share their data or authorize transactions with Data Recipients.
End User Delegates : refers to delegated persons or entities, such as End Users’
CPAs, brokers, fiduciaries and other advisors, who have been authorized by the
End User to grant permission to share and receive the End Users’ Financial
Account Information on the End Users’ behalf.
```
```
Data Providers : the entities who hold End Users’ Financial Account Information,
including, without limitation to banks, credit unions and brokerages.
```
```
Data Recipients : service companies, applications (financial apps), Fintechs,
financial institutions, products and services where End Users (on their own or
through their End User Delegates) manage or act on their finances, whether
actively managing their finances (such as moving money or applying for credit) or
passively doing so (such as garnering recommendations or insights).
```
```
Data Access Platforms : intermediaries that facilitate financial data access,
transit, storage and/or permissioning on behalf of Data Recipients or End Users,
also commonly referred to as “data aggregators”. In some cases, Data Access
Platforms may not have a direct relationship with the End User. The data may be
passed through without modification or may be normalized in line with permitted
objectives (e.g., parsed for readability or used to confirm other data). Data
Access Platforms should not be misidentified with parties who do not obtain End
Users’ consent but gather data, sometimes referred to as Data Brokers^5 or Data
Harvesters.
```
```
Credentials : any data used to identify the End User to the Data Provider,
such as a username and password pair, to gain access to the End User’s
Financial Account Information.
```
```
Unique Customer Record ( aka Consumer Account) : One Credential per
direct connection to a Data Provider from a Data Access Platform or a
directly-connected Data Recipient.
```
```
Financial Account Information : the financial accounts, statuses, histories,
statements, balances and holdings, plus transactions reflecting monetary and
financial actions directly sourced from Data Providers.
```
```
Derived Financial Data : consists of observations, data profiles, analysis or models
derived from Financial Account Information.
```
```
Customer Identity Data : information about the End User that can be used to
uniquely identify such End User.
```

```
Government ID Number : Any government-issued unique identifying number for a
person or other recognized entity, such as a Social Security Number (SSN), Social
Insurance Number (SIN), Employer Identification Number (EIN) or Tax ID Number
(TIN).
Fintech : the word, is a combination of "financial technology" and often refers to a
financial technology company that offers automated tools to End Users to use their
financial data.
```
```
Screen Scraping (aka Data Scraping and Web Scraping ): a method for the
retrieval of Financial Account Information typically using an End User’s Account
Credentials (provided by End Users to a third party to obtain their Financial
Account Information as though the End Users were connecting to the Data
Provider). The modality of such access is often, but not limited to, from an HTML
(hypertext markup language) page via electronic means (usually via automated
script) but can also be from terminal emulation, API, or other interface.2,3,
```
```
Open Finance/Open Banking: While these terms are evolving and are often used
interchangeably, they generally refer to an End User’s ability to access and share their
own financial data. Different terms are often linked to the presence or lack of regulation,
whether they be government-regulated financial data sharing regimes, market driven
systems of End User permissioned data sharing or some hybrid of the two. Other similar
terms include consumer directed finance, connected banking or permissioned data
sharing.
```
```
Strong Customer Authentication (SCA): prescribes the use of two or more of these
factors (known as Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) ):
```
```
 Type 1 – Something you know – passwords, PINs, code words, etc.
 Type 2 – Something you have – typically smart phones, token
devices, etc.
 Type 3 – Something you are – Biometrics (e.g., fingerprints, facial
recognition, iris or retina scans).
```
**End User Authentication** : process by which the End User’s access to Financial Account
Information is authenticated by the Data Provider. This is accomplished via different
mechanisms:

```
 Legacy tech (aka Account Credentials-based access ) – the Data Access Platform
or Data Recipient typically stores the End User’s Account Credentials and
authenticates access to accounts with the Data Provider on behalf of the End
User. Such access is typically limited to Type 1 authentication factors (see
authentication factors above).
 Modern tech (aka tokenized access ) –The End User authenticates directly with
the Data Provider. Note: End Users do not provide their Account Credentials to
either the Data Recipient or the Data Access Platform in this model.
```

```
End User Authorization : Process by which the End User gives permission to a Data
Provider to share their Financial Account Information with Data Access Platforms or
Data Recipients:
```
```
 Legacy tech (aka Account Credentials based access ) – the End Users provide
their Account Credentials to the Data Recipient and/or the Data Access Platform
for access to the Data Provider on behalf of the End User. The resulting Consent
can only be revoked at the Data Recipient or the Data Access Platform.
 Modern tech (aka tokenized access ) – The End Users authorize the Data
Providers directly or via Data Access Platforms to share their Financial Account
Information with the Data Recipients. In addition to consent management and
revocation at the Data Recipient and Data Access Platform, this also permits the
Data Provider to manage the End User Consent and allows the End User to
revoke it at the Data Provider.
```
```
Business Purpose : The service being provided by the data recipient for which data
access is needed.
```
```
Consent : The permission granted by an End User to share their data from a Data Provider
to a Data Recipient. Consent may be held by the Data Provider, Data Access Platform, or
the Data Recipient as defined by the bilateral agreement(s) for the entities involved.
```
```
Data Cluster : A group of data elements that communicate to an End User the scope of
data to be shared under a consent.
```
```
End User Notification : Any communication to an end user, such as email or text, that a
data sharing event has occurred.
```
```
Event Notification : The notification of a specific event generated by one entity to inform
another.
```
```
Application : The software product or service provided by a data recipient that is used by
the End User.
```
### OTHER FINANCIAL DATA SHARING TERMINOLOGY

```
Data Brokers: collect personal information from public and private records and provide
this information to public and private sector entities for many purposes, from marketing
to law enforcement and homeland security purposes^5.
```
```
Data Harvesters: use communication and information services, including applications
(apps), to collect data from End Users and provide the data or derived digital products to
third parties.
```

### CONCEPTUAL FLOW

End Users permission Data Providers to share their Financial Account Information with Data
Recipients as shown below:


### CONSENT AND USER EXPERIENCE TAXONOMY

```
Consent Issuer : The entity that generates a Consent when granted by the End User. The
Consent Issuer may also respond to requests to provide Consent details.
```
```
Consent API : The application programming interface that transmits Consent Scope data.
```
```
Consent Scope : The specification that defines what data is requested, between whom,
its purpose, and duration for a specific consent granted by an End User.
```
```
Authorized Accounts : Accounts held at the Data Provider to which an End User permits
access under the Consent. (Accounts, and other resources, are declared scopes.)
```
```
Consent Duration : The agreed upon time frame for the length of Consent, such as time-
based, persistent, or one-time. Refer to the User Experience Guidelines document for the
current definition of each duration. (Duration is a declared scope.)
```
```
Consent Status : The current state of the consent as either Active, Revoked, or Expired.
```
```
Active Consent : Granted Consent that is not expired or revoked. This is the only state in
which data can be shared or actions can be taken on behalf of the End User.
```
```
Revoked Consent : An inactive state caused by the explicit removal of Consent before
expiration. Once revoked, the Data Provider shall no longer share any data with the
specified Data Recipient.
```
```
Expired Consent : An inactive state caused by the occurrence of a time limit and was not
renewed. Once expired, the Data Provider shall no longer share any data with the
specified Data Recipient.
```
```
Consent Revocation : An action to revoke consent that can occur at a Data Provider, Data
Recipient, or Data Access Platform via a Consent Dashboard or another experience. Can
be initiated by the end user or by an involved party.
```
```
Consent Dashboard : A digital experience that enables the End User to view, edit, or
revoke the Consents they’ve granted and the parties or processes accessing data.
```
### MONEY MOVEMENT TAXONOMY

```
Money Movement : The process to execute a digital payment or transfer. This may
include forms of digital execution such as digital or crypto currencies, but does not
include paper-based and coin-based methods such as paper checks and physical
currencies.
```
```
Payment Service Provider (PSP)/Payment Processor : financial institution or entity that
connects to payment networks (e.g., ACH, Visa, MasterCard, SWIFT) for the End User to
move money via payment initiators.
```

    - Capabilities to a payment user to setup and initiate payments
    - Capabilities to a business payee to collect credit, debit, or account / routing
       numbers, such that the payment is then initiated as debit by the merchant to
       the payer’s account. These are called **Merchant Services**.
- **Payment Network Access APIs** expose access to payment rails to payment
    service providers. These are not subject to the same tokenized access needs as
    the PSP APIs. Only authorized, regulated providers are able to access such APIs.

**Payment Access Platforms** : Intermediaries that facilitate payment initiation services on
behalf of payment initiators.

**Payment Initiator** : Service companies, Applications (financial apps), financial
institutions, products and services where End Users (on their own or through their End
User Delegates) facilitate sending payment instructions to a Payment Service Provider
(PSP).

**Transfer** : The movement of funds from one account to another account owned by the
same entity.


```
Internal Transfer : A Transfer of funds between accounts owned by the same legal entity
at a single financial institution.
```
```
External Transfer : A Transfer of funds between accounts owned by the same legal entity
held at different financial institutions.
```
```
Scheduled Transfer : A future dated Transfer.
```
```
Recurring Transfer : A series of regularly occurring Transfers.
```
```
Merchant : A specific type of a payee, typically a business from which goods or services

11_Report_Final_E.pdf

```
Application programming interface (API) : An application programming interface (API) is
a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. It acts as a
universal access point by which information is retrieved from a database. APIs are the
main technological mechanism by which data would be securely shared between a bank
and a third-party provider in an open banking framework.
```
```
Consumer Data Right: The right of Australian consumers to have control over their data.
The right will be implemented sector-by-sector, beginning in the banking, energy and
telecommunications sectors.
```
```
Financial Data Portability: Financial data portability is the ability of consumers to direct
that their personal financial information be shared with another organization.
```
```
Fintech: Fintech refers to both the innovative ideas being developed into financial
services technologies and applications, as well as the businesses that are offering these
services. While fintech usually refers to independent financial services businesses,
banks also offer fintech applications.
```
```
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): The GDPR is the European Union (EU)’s
privacy and data protection legislation which came into effect in 2018. It sets out several
privacy rights for individuals, including the right to obtain one’s personal data from a
company and send it to a third party and the right to have personal information erased
and no longer shared with third parties.
```
```
Open Banking: Open banking generally refers to a framework to give customers access
to and control over their financial data. In most countries, open banking has two
elements: financial data portability and payments initiation.
```
```
Open Data: Open Data is structured data that is machine-readable, freely shared, used
and built on without restrictions. One of the goals of an open data initiative is to enable
computer-to-computer transfer of information using a universal access point, called an
API, to retrieve information from a database.
```

**Payments Initiation:** Payments initiation is the enabling of payments directly from a bank
account using a smartphone app, as an alternative to credit and debit card payments.

**Screen Scraping:** Screen scraping is the process by which certain smartphone apps
access banking data. Some fintech companies will use a customer’s online banking
